Additional information:
I used Node.js and Express to develop the API, because of the familiarity I have with it and the fact that it solves all requested requirements with easiness.
It was decided to not include a database integration, because of the low complexity of the API, if needed it is not complicated to implement MongoDB as it is a well-supported database for Node.js and it doesn't require much maintenance.
